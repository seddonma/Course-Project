# Course Project Codebook

This codebook is meant to act as a guide to the variables used in the run_analysis.R file included in this repository. The end result of this  R file is a tidy data frame called tiny_dataset.txt that shows the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Please see the README enclosed in this repository for a description of the run_analysis.R script creates the tiny_dataset.text dataset. 

The script run_analysis.R uses data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0). This data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones (link active as of May 24, 2015). The Human Activity Recognition database is built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The raw and tidy datasets contains four types of variables:

1. SubjectID
2. Activity 
3. Measurement (raw)
4. Mean (tidy)

1. SubjectID
This a numberic identifier that ranges from 1-30 that denotes the subject of the experiment 

2. Activity
The Activity variable is one of the six strings below and indictes the type of activity the subject was performing at the time.
  1 WALKING
  2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  4 SITTING
  5 STANDING
  6 LAYING
  
3. Measurement
These measurments come from the raw Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and do not pertain to the tidy_dataset.txt variables. 
The following is a list of the measurements that come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. mean() indictaes the mean value and std() indicate the standard deviation.
